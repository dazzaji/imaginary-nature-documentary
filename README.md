# Provocation:

> If I made a nature documentary and a baby animal was lost and dying, I'd bring the baby to its parents on screen and add a David Attenborough style voiceover like "And here we see a human, following its instinctive desire to care for the young of other species." - [Amanda Askell](https://x.com/amandaaskell/status/1859707679620612605?s=46&t=91uxEd7YzjICwwNnxcr-KA)

David Attenborough: "And here we see a human, not just observing, but participating in the intricate dance of life and death. A quiet intervention, a delicate touch, an acknowledgement that the line between observer and participant is often an illusion."

## Imaginary Nature Documentary Concept 2 - [Instinct: The Wild and the Human Heart](https://github.com/dazzaji/imaginary-nature-documentary/blob/main/NatureOfLife-ClaraUniverse.md)

David Attenborough: "As we look upon the natural world, we must recognize that we are not separate from it. We are part of it, shaped by the same forces, driven by the same instincts. To care, to nurture, to protectâ€”it is not a departure from nature, but perhaps the purest expression of it."

Documentarian: "We're taught not to intervene in nature. But when humans have already intervened by changing the climate, by destroying habitats... what exactly is 'natural' anymore?"
