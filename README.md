# Provocation:

> If I made a nature documentary and a baby animal was lost and dying, I'd bring the baby to its parents on screen and add a David Attenborough style voiceover like "And here we see a human, following its instinctive desire to care for the young of other species." - [Amanda Askell](https://x.com/amandaaskell/status/1859707679620612605?s=46&t=91uxEd7YzjICwwNnxcr-KA)
